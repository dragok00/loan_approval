# Loan Approval Classification

This Jupyter Notebook implements a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approvals. It performs data preprocessing (e.g., cleaning and encoding features) and trains multiple classifiers. The pipeline includes training **decision tree**, **random forest**, **XGBoost**, and **support vector machine (SVM)** models. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix to measure prediction correctness.

## Models Used

- **Decision Tree** – tree-based classifier  
- **Random Forest** – ensemble of decision trees  
- **XGBoost** – gradient boosting algorithm  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – large-margin classifier  

## Required Libraries

- **Python 3.x** – runtime environment  
- **pandas** – data manipulation library  
- **NumPy** – numerical computing library  
- **scikit-learn** – machine learning library  
- **XGBoost** – gradient boosting library  

## Running the Notebook

1. Install the required libraries (for example, run `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost catboost`)  
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`) and open the project folder  
3. Open `loan_approval_classification.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface  
4. Run all cells to execute the preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps
